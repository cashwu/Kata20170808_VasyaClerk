The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single `100`, `50` or `25` dollars bill. A "Avengers" ticket costs `25 dollars`.

Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

Can Vasya sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line?

Return `YES`, if Vasya can sell a ticket to each person and give the change. Otherwise return `NO`.

###Examples:

```
// === C Sharp ===

Line.Tickets(new int[] {25, 25, 50}) // => YES 
Line.Tickets(new int[] {25, 100})  // => NO. Vasya will not have enough money to give change to 100 dollars
```

### 中文大意

有三種面額的貨幣(25、50、100)，顧客會依序購買電影票(25)，看可不可以找的開
